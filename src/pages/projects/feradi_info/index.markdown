JumpStart Georgia creates visualizations of many different kinds, including infographics, interactives, videos, and gifographics. We publish these visualizations on [feradi.info](https://feradi.info) ("feradi" means "colorful" in Georgian).

My contributions to feradi.info consisted of making the site more responsive, as well as adding the ability for us to upload video and gifographic visualizations.
