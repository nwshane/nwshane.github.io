I created the website for JumpStart's GogoCode project, which teaches teenage girls in Georgia the basics of computer programming and encourages their participation in STEM subjects. I built the site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and in the process solidified my ability to use component-based CSS to manage complex, responsive styles.
