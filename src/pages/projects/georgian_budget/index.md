JumpStart Georgia requested data about the national Georgian budget from the Georgian government in 2016. We received spreadsheets and PDFs containing valuable, but disconnected, financial data.

As the lead developer on this project, I organized the financial data and created a website visualizing the data. I chose to separate the frontend (React/Redux) from the backend (Rails), which contains the API and the data uploader.

If you're interested in contributing to this project, here are the relevant repositories:
