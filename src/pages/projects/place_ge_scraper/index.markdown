The folks at [ISET](http://www.iset.ge/ "International School of Economics in Tbilisi") wanted to analyze the state of Georgia's real estate market, so we wrote this [scraper](https://github.com/JumpStartGeorgia/Place-ge-Scraper) to get that data for them. Our source was place.ge, an online real estate market in Georgia.
