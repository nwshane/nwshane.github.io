When this [list of Azerbaijani political prisoners][prisoners-list-aug2014] was published in August, 2014, it served as a condemnation of the deteriorating human rights situation in Azerbaijan. Yet, its impact was limited by its PDF presentation, which made studying and understanding the trends it represented painfully difficult.

My colleagues and I at [JumpStart Georgia][jumpstart-url] built Prisoners.Watch to fix this problem. As the lead developer on the project, I wrote a parser to extract the information in the August 2014 list into a database of prisoners, arrests, prisons, and charges. I then built a web application to provide access to the database, so that 1) the data would be available to everyone, and 2) the data could be updated as the situation on the ground changed in Azerbaijan.

Today, the content of [Prisoners.Watch]({{page.mainUrl}}) is kept up to date by journalists at [Meydan TV][meydan-tv-url] and presents an authoritative and comprehensive source for information about Azerbaijani political prisoners.
