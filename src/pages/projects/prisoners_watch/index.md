When this [list of Azerbaijani political prisoners](http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/THE%20LIST%20-%2098%20political%20prisoners%20in%20Azerbaijan%20-%20August%202014.pdf) was published in August, 2014, it served as a condemnation of the deteriorating human rights situation in Azerbaijan. However, its impact was limited by its PDF presentation, which made studying and understanding the trends it represented painfully difficult.

I built Prisoners.Watch at [JumpStart Georgia](http://jumpstart.ge) to fix this problem. I wrote a parser to extract the information in the August 2014 list into a database of prisoners, arrests, prisons, and charges, and then provided access to the data with a Rails web app.

Unfortunately, Prisoners.Watch is no longer available online. But the code is [open source](https://github.com/JumpStartGeorgia/Azerbaijan-Political-Prisoners), so you're welcome to contribute to the project or fork and host your own version.
