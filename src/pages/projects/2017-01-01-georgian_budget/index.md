JumpStart Georgia requested data about the national Georgian budget from the Georgian government in 2016. We received spreadsheets and PDFs containing valuable, but disconnected, financial data.

As the sole developer on this project, I was challenged to organize the financial data and create a website visualizing the data. I chose to separate the frontend, for which I used React/Redux, from the backend, which uses Rails.
