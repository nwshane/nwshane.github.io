[ScottShane.Net](http://scottshane.net) is the site of Scott Shane, a journalist for the New York Times and an award-winning author. (Oh yeahâ€”he's also my dad! :) ) The site is fully responsive, has a built-in content management system, and features a nice page for Scott's book, *Objective Troy*.
