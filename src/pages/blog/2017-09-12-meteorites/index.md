title: Meteorites and Things
---

That's right, I'm starting a blog! I give no guarantees that I'll write here often, or that I'll write about certain topics. Basically, I just want a place where I can write—about tech subjects, about interesting things I've learned, about what's been up in my life. Who knows what I'll write about!

For this inaugural post, I'm going to go far out and present to you a visualization of a dataset I've had my eye on for an embarrassing amount of time now. Yup, you've got it—the main reason I'm writing about this is to get it off my mind.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, let me present to you... a visualization of meteorites! Specifically, meteorite landings recorded by NASA and released online at the [Meteorite Landings API](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings-api/resource/83ca7a13-4077-435f-a39e-9330c07741ad). The data was last updated in November, 2015, so I apologize that it's a bit out of date. But still pretty cool in my opinion!

(((INSERT meteorite viz here!)))
