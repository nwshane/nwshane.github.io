Hi folks! I’m Nathan, and yes, this is my grand entrance into the blogosphere!

I’ve decided that I want to have a space to share what’s going in my head and my life—whether that be technical subjects, cat memes, reflections on books I’m reading, random stuff I find interesting, depressing psychological self-analysis (just kidding, maybe), tasty recipes, life updates... pretty much anything I want to write about.

I know that’s a bit vague, so I’ll try to clarify my primary reason for starting this blog. I’ve experimented with various learning techniques over the past few years, and one that’s really stuck has been my use of flashcards. I make flashcards for everything ([Anki] anyone?), because I’ve found that flashcards help my ailing 27-year old memory remember what I learned yesterday, a month ago, and even a year ago.

Yet, flashcards aren’t ideal for all kinds of learning. Each flashcard only tests a single idea, concept, entity; often, it’s hard to truly contextualize and understand a subject in depth just by breaking it up into parts and testing those parts separately. Recently, I’ve realized that I want to attain greater depth in my understanding of certain technical tools and concepts.

So how to achieve this kind of depth? Well, I’ve noticed that when I explain something to another person, I’m forced to place my explanation in a broader context in a way that solidifies my knowledge and reveals the holes in my understanding. This is probably old news to a lot of you (it certainly was to [Richard Feynman]). Writing allows a kind of depth that goes beyond just verbal explanation, and so I’d like to use this blog as a platform to teach other people about whatever I’m learning, thus clarifying my own knowledge and helping others along the way.

Back to the current moment. I’m nearing the halfway point of my 12-week batch here at the [Recurse Center], and I’ve been feeling a bit scattered and overwhelmed. I was thrown off my stride by a bike accident a few weeks ago, and the ensuing health troubles, insurance bureaucracy, and doctors’ appointments have interfered in my learning. So, In an attempt to get back on track, I’ll state my priorities for the next couple of weeks:

- Deploy this blog (now finished!)
- Add an interactive component to this site. I’ll let you all know when it’s there, and describe how I made it :)
- Continue CS50x, an online course on the fundamentals of computer science
- Finish the first version of my site about church music in the Republic of Georgia
- Create some data visualizations to practice using d3, a visualization library in JavaScript that I’ve been learning

That's all for now! Hurray blogging!
