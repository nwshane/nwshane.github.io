When this [list of Azerbaijani political prisoners](prisoners-list-aug2014) was published in August, 2014, it served as a condemnation of the deteriorating human rights situation in Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, its impact was limited by its PDF presentation, which made studying and understanding the trends it represented painfully difficult.

My colleagues and I at [JumpStart Georgia](jumpstart-url) built Prisoners.Watch to fix this problem. We extracted the information in the August 2014 list into a database of prisoners, arrests, prisons, and charges, and then built a web application on top of it so that 1) the data would be available to everyone, and 2) the data could be updated as the situation on the ground changed in Azerbaijan.

Today, the content of [Prisoners.Watch]({{page.main-url}}) is kept up to date by the journalists at [Meydan TV](meydan-tv-url), and presents an authoritative and comprehensive source for information about Azerbaijani political prisoners.
