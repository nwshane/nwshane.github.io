We at JumpStart Georgia create visualizations of many different kinds, including infographics, interactives, videos, and gifographics. We publish these visualizations on [feradi.info]({{ page.main-url }}) ("feradi" means "colorful" in Georgian).

My contributions to feradi.info have consisted of making the site more responsive, as well as adding the ability for us to upload video and gifographic visualizations.
