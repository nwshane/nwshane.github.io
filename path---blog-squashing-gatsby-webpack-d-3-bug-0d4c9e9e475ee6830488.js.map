Maybe it had something to do with webpack?

Well... sort of. I had traced it to a single line of my own code, but there was a whole lot going on under the hood that I didn’t understand. In my confusion, I came up with two specific questions:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Why does importing d3, a frontend data viz library, cause webpack to import the <code>xmlhttprequest</code> module, which is used for making http requests on the server?</li>\\n<li>How is it possible that built-in node libraries like <code>child_process</code> and <code>fs</code> can fail to be imported?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>All I wanted to do was play around a bit with d3 and start making this game! At a loss, I decided to make a separate, smaller application with no framework to see if I could get d3 working with webpack. A little while later, I had a small app with a tiny webpack config, and—what do you know—<code>import * as d3 from ‘d3’</code> worked just fine. This gave rise to a third question:</p>\\n<p>Why does importing d3 break in my Gatsby app, but work fine in my small, custom webpack config app?</p>\\n<p>At this point, I laid the bug to rest for a while, both so that I could get some practice with d3 and to let my unconscious mind (hopefully) solve the problem for me.</p>\\n<p>The next day, I paired with another person at the <a href=\\\"https://www.recurse.com/\\\">Recurse Center</a>, but neither of us were able to make any real progress on this bug.

Without him, it’s possible I’d probably still be stuck in bug land.</p>\\n<p>Just as a reminder, this is the error message I was getting:</p>\\n<pre><code> WAIT  Compiling...\\n\\n ERROR  Failed to compile with 2 errors\\n\\nThese dependencies were not found:\\n\\n* child_process in ./~/xmlhttprequest/lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\\n* fs in ./~/xmlhttprequest/lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\\n\\nTo install them, you can run: npm install --save child_process fs\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Almost immediately, Harold and I noticed that we could make this error go away by replacing the import all of d3 statement...</p>\\n<p>import * as d3 from ‘d3’</p>\\n<p>...with statements importing parts of specific libraries. For example:</p>\\n<pre><code>import {forceSimulation} from ‘d3’\\nimport {selectAll} from ‘d3’\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We also figured out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/josephsavona/valuable/issues/9#issuecomment-65000999\\\">another way</a> to patch the problem. Webpack lets you override the return value for node modules; you can make <code>require(‘fs’)</code> and <code>require(‘child_process’)</code> return empty objects like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>node: {\\n  fs: \\\"empty\\\",\\n  child_process: \\\"empty\\\"\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Of these two fixes, I especially liked the first one, because it would also reduce bundle size—and I think that’s what I’ll be going with in the future. So we were done, right? Problem solved? Well, both Harold and I were curious enough about the origin of this error that we decided to continue digging.</p>\\n<p>After all, the original questions that had so vexed me earlier were still unanswered:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Why does importing d3, a frontend data viz library, cause webpack to import xmlhttprequest, used for making http requests?</li>\\n<li>How is it possible that built-in node libraries like <code>child_process</code> and <code>fs</code> can fail to be imported?</li>\\n<li>Why does importing d3 break in my Gatsby app, but work fine in my small, custom webpack config app?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>To begin answering the first question, Harold had the idea of searching for xmlhttprequest in package-lock.json. Sure enough, <code>xmlhttprequest</code> was being required by <code>d3-request</code>, and <code>d3-request</code> was being required by <code>d3</code>.</p>\\n<pre><code># package-lock.json\\n{\\n  ...\\n  \\\"d3-request\\\": {\\n      ...\\n      \\\"requires\\\": {\\n        ...\\n        \\\"xmlhttprequest\\\": \\\"1.8.0\\\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n  ...,\\n  {\\n    “d3”: {\\n      \\\"requires\\\": {\\n        ...\\n        \\\"d3-request\\\": \\\"1.0.6\\\",\\n        ...\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>But why would a part of d3 specify a dependency that depends on node? Reading d3-request’s documentation closely, we realized that d3-request is meant to be used both on the server and in the browser. A module is able to provide different entry points into itself via the package.json, and taking a look at <code>d3-request</code>’s package.json revealed no less than five different entry points into the module:</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n  ...\\n  \\\"main\\\": \\\"build/d3-request.node.js\\\",\\n  \\\"unpkg\\\": \\\"build/d3-request.js\\\",\\n  \\\"jsdelivr\\\": \\\"build/d3-request.js\\\",\\n  \\\"module\\\": \\\"index\\\",\\n  \\\"jsnext:main\\\": \\\"index.js\\\",\\n  ...\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice anything about those entry points? The <code>main</code> property is set to the node build! Now we were onto something: if webpack defaulted to importing the <code>main</code> entry point of a module, then that would cause the following import chain:</p>\\n<pre><code>import * as d3 from ‘d3’\\n=> d3-request\\n=> xmlhttprequest\\n=> fs and child_process\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>At around this time, one of us noticed something else of interest: Gatsby was using version 1 of webpack! I jumped over to my custom webpack config app, and checked the version of webpack, which was version 3. We changed the version to 1, migrated webpack’s config to the version 1 syntax, and checked the build step: and it broke!</p>\\n<p>Resolution</p>\\n<p>Almost there, I promise! To recap, we had learned two critical pieces of information:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><code>d3-request</code> provides a node-based build via package.json’s ‘main’ attribute, as well as a few other builds</li>\\n<li>webpack version 1 failed with the import * as d3 statement, whereas webpack version 3 worked</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>With these two things in mind, Harold and I tracked down the methods by which these two versions of webpack choose between module builds.
