If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/curryN.js\n// module id = ./node_modules/ramda/src/curryN.js\n// module chunks = 168707334958949","var add = require('./add');\n\n\n/**\n * Decrements its argument.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.9.0\n * @category Math\n * @sig Number -> Number\n * @param {Number} n\n * @return {Number} n - 1\n * @see R.inc\n * @example\n *\n *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\n */\nmodule.exports = add(-1);\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/dec.js\n// module id = ./node_modules/ramda/src/dec.js\n// module chunks = 168707334958949","var _curry2 = require('./internal/_curry2');\n\n\n/**\n * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`;\n * otherwise the first argument is returned.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.10.0\n * @category Logic\n * @sig a -> b -> a | b\n * @param {a} default The default value.\n * @param {b} val `val` will be returned instead of `default` unless `val` is `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`.\n * @return {*} The second value if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`, otherwise the default value\n * @example\n *\n *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\n *\n *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\n *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\n *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\n *      // parseInt('string') results in NaN\n *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\n  return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/defaultTo.js\n// module id = ./node_modules/ramda/src/defaultTo.js\n// module chunks = 168707334958949","var _curry3 = require('./internal/_curry3');\n\n\n/**\n * Makes a descending comparator function out of a function that returns a value\n * that can be compared with `<` and `>`.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.23.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Ord b => (a -> b) -> a -> a -> Number\n * @param {Function} fn A function of arity one that returns a value that can be compared\n * @param {*} a The first item to be compared.\n * @param {*} b The second item to be compared.\n * @return {Number} `-1` if fn(a) > fn(b), `1` if fn(b) > fn(a), otherwise `0`\n * @see R.ascend\n * @example\n *\n *      var byAge = R.descend(R.prop('age'));\n *      var people = [\n *        // ...\n *      ];\n *      var peopleByOldestFirst = R.sort(byAge, people);\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry3(function descend(fn, a, b) {\n  var aa = fn(a);\n  var bb = fn(b);\n  return aa > bb ? -1 : aa < bb ? 1 : 0;\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/descend.js\n// module id = ./node_modules/ramda/src/descend.js\n// module chunks = 168707334958949","var _contains = require('./internal/_contains');\nvar _curry2 = require('./internal/_curry2');\n\n\n/**\n * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not\n * contained in the second list.
