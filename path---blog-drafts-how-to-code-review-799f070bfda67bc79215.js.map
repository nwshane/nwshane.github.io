If one of these speaks to you in particular, try to keep it in mind the next time you review someone's code.</p>\\n<h3>🧠 Understand what you're reviewing</h3>\\n<p>Make sure to educate yourself about the background of a pull request before you start reviewing: read the product story (if there is one), briefly skim the code, and ask for more context if necessary.</p>\\n<h3>📒 Figure out how thoroughly to review</h3>\\n<p>If the code affects a high-traffic API endpoint, you'd better review it very thoroughly; if it's just for a prototype that won't go into master, then you can likely just skim it. Ask the coder if you're not sure!</p>\\n<h3>🔨 Figure out if you need to QA</h3>\\n<p>To QA a pull request means to check that the code changes actually work. You'll need to open the app and test out any new user facing features / verify that there are no regressions. (QA stands for Quality Assurance and is used as a verb.)</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, a different person (such as a product manager) will QA the PR and you won't have to. Generally, though, it's good to have both the code reviewer and the product manager QA a pull request, so remember to do that!

The coder can ask you to review again before they merge if they think it's necessary.</p>\\n<h3>📜 Provide context and steps to reproduce for problems</h3>\\n<p>If you discover a problem, explain it as clearly as you can. Make sure you give enough detail for other people to understand what the problem is (i.e. steps to reproduce in their own environment) and why it's a problem in the first place. Screenshots and snapshots can be super helpful (I use <a href=\\\"https://monosnap.com/\\\">monosnap</a> for that).</p>\\n<h3>❌ Review the code that <em>wasn't</em> written</h3>\\n<p>For example, sometimes a task will consist of changing method A to method B throughout the entire codebase. For this kind of task, the reviewer can't stop at reviewing the code in the PR; they also need to search for method A in the codebase, to double check that the coder changed everything they needed to.</p>\\n<h3>💨🏃🏽‍♀️🏃‍♀️💨 Review quickly to unblock others</h3>\\n<p>Whenever possible, prioritize unblocking other people over your own work. That includes reviewing their code as soon as you can; pairing with them to help fix their problems; basically anything you can provide to minimize the time they have to wait around. This is crucial for getting a team to move quickly and nimbly and to reduce frustration.</p>\\n<h3>🤨 Distinguish between personal preference and valuable feedback</h3>\\n<p>It can be tricky to distinguish between these two. If you're unsure, then you can always ask what the other person thinks!</p>\\n<h3>💬 Over-communicate + Talk in person</h3>\\n<p>Sometimes it's easier just to talk about something in person instead of going back and forth in slack for three hours. If you think that's the case, go for it!</p>\\n<h3>🙆 Get a third opinion</h3>\\n<p>If you disagree with the coder about an aspect of their code, do your best to find a compromise that you both agree with. If that isn't possible, then ask a third party for another opinion.</p>\\n<h3>🌎️ Keep the big picture in mind</h3>\\n<p>Always ask yourself the question: is it worth both your time and the other engineer's time to discuss a particular aspect of code? For example, it might not be fully necessary to ask the other engineer to refactor some code, even if you think it would be better had they written it differently. Pick your battles.</p>\\n<h3>❤️ Be compassionate and keep an open mind</h3>\\n<p>Remember that it's impossible to write perfect code, and that we all have different backgrounds and perspectives on coding.
